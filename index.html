The 3 lights I used were Ambient Light, Directional Light, HemisphereLight. The extras that I need where pikcing, fog, and multiple cameras. The story I was trying to go for here is from how Sonic game lore is. Sonic always get rings, Shadow uses emeralds for chaos control, and Silver teleports to different worlds which is why there is different elements in front of him.");
